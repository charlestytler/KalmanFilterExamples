# KalmanFilterExamples
Simple Examples of a Kalman Filter

**kf_1DOF_linear.py**  
A 1 degree of freedom (DOF) example of a kalman filter fusing acceleration and range measurements. The filter tracks 3 states: velocity, position, and accelerometer bias  

**kf_1DOF_nonlinear.py**  
A 1 degree of freedom (DOF) example of a kalman filter fusing acceleration and range measurements. The filter tracks 4 states: velocity, position, accelerometer bias, and accelerometer scaling
